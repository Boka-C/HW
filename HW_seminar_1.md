# Git instruction

## 1. Program availibility check: 
In a Visual code go to Terminal (Ctrl+`) and type the ```git version``` command, if Git is installed correctly, you will see its version (ex.: *git version 2.39.0.windows.1*), if not, you will see the error message and will have to install Git (go to paragraph 2). 
## 2. Installing Git.
Follow the link https://git-scm.com/downloads and download the version compatible with your device.
Install the program with default settings.
## 3. Introducing yourself to GIT. 
After installing the program, you have to introduce yourself to Git, so it'll know who's saving the versions.
To do that, you need to open Terminal (*in VS for example*) again (Ctrl+`) and run 2 commands:

```git config --global user.name «Your name with Latin letters»```

and

```git config --global user.email «Your e-mail» ```
